Testing versions

Base features: (All versions will have these features, may specify implementation/change in implementation in version):
- alpha/beta
- TT table(will specify replacement scheme under version if changed, otherwise replace if newer iteration and replace when deeper ply)
- nmp(r value of 3)
- basic move ordering(mvv lva, hash move, killer move, history heuristic)
- classical bitboard move generation(will eventually switch to magic bbs)
- 2 killer moves
- history heuristic
- threefold repetition
- quiescent search with delta pruning


Astarion_V1 features:
- Base features
- PeSTOs evaluation
- Basic time controls, not considering increment

V2:
- nmp r value changed to 4
- check extensions(if depth 0)
- fixed zobrist hashing bug
- fixed 3 move repetition bug
- big improvement

V2.1:
- move ordering tweak, killer moves before bad captures
- delta pruning now off

V2.2:
- fixed mate bug
- killer moves/history only updating on quiet moves now
- promotion bug fix

V3:
- Static exchange evaluation(SEE)
- In normal search SEE only evaluates "losing" captures, "losing" captures with positive/equal SEE get sorted after winning/equal MVVLVA captures, "losing" captures with negative SEE get sorted to the end of the list.
- In qSearch SEE only evaluates "losing" captures, "losing captures" with negative SEE are pruned completely.
- From a small amount of testing, it seems my engine would be a little over 1700 on CCRL blitz 

V4:
- LMR(reducing after 3 moves, not reducing pv nodes/when depth below 3, captures, promotions, checks)
- Bug fixes(fixed bug parsing positions with promotion moves, threefold repetition bug)
- From a small amount of testing, engine seems to be about ~1820 ccrl blitz

V5: 
- More bug fixes(fixed promotion bug again, fixed mate bug, fixed weird reference bug, explanation in github push request)
- first bug free version
- Time controls change(take 2x time)

V5.1:
- PV hack

V5.2:
- TT table fix

V5.3:
- More aggressive LMR

V5.4:
- Futility pruning

V5.5:
- Futility pruning tweak(not when in check)
- Null move pruning tweak(not when side to move has no minor pieces)
